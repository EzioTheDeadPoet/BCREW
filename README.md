# BCREW - Batch Copy Replace Ends With

## About

A small programm I needed for a very specific file operation related to texture modding.
Could potentially be upgraded to do more in the future.

## Use

**There are no backups created. So use carefully.**
*Use Argument 4 to clone the file stucture contained in the directory  of A3 with the file from A2.As an less destructive alternative.*

Run the program with the following 3 arguments:
- Argument 1: EndsWithSelector (Endstring of Filesnames to replace.)
- Argument 2: Source File (Copy Target)
- Argument 3: Argument 3: Target Directory (Files to replace/Filestructure to mirror with Argument 4)
- Argument 4: Output Directory
