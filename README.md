# BCREW - Batch Copy Replace Ends With

## About

A small programm I needed for a very specific file operation related to texture modding.
Could potentially be upgraded to do more in the future.

## Use

**There are no backups created. So use carefully.**

Run the program with the following 3 arguments:
- Argument 1: Source File (Copy Target)
- Argument 2: Target Directory (Files to replace)
- Argument 3: EndsWithSelector (Endstring of Files to replace.)
